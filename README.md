Socialize GitHub then you can really code better, together (fake)

# Features

Sticky GitHub's header: auto-hide when scrolling down and show when scrolling up  
**Compose your ideas**: share your ideas and thoughts and see what from others  
Remove Github jobs promotion: uh, maybe not a good news for GitHub, so it's optional  
... 

# Dev

|Commands|Description|
|---|---|
|lsc-gulp|run the dev environment, build and watch|
|lsc-gulp build|build for production use|

Check out a new branch and add features there, name the branch with what you would do to it, use gulp to build and watch.
Then why livescript? for I'm a newbie on it, trying to learn more.
